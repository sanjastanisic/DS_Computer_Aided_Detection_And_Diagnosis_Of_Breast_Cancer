# Computer Aided Detection and Diagnosis of Breast Cancer

This project focused on developing a computer-aided diagnostic system to support early detection of breast cancer. Utilizing the CBIS-DDSM dataset, which includes over 750 calcification cases, the data was preprocessed through image enhancement, automated lesion segmentation, and metadata extraction. A custom graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to assist radiologists in reviewing and interpreting mammography images. The system incorporated clinical annotations such as BI-RADS scores and breast density categories, in line with standardized diagnostic frameworks. By integrating machine learning techniques and automating key diagnostic processes, the solution improves radiologist workflow and enables more accurate identification of early-stage breast cancer.
